# Simple Maze Generator

This generator can generate some mazes with rooms

## Usage
```
python ./maze.py <width of maze> <height of maze> <count of rooms> <maximum length of room> <minimux length of room> <probability of door-generation>
```

Notice that two generated rooms probably intersect with each others.
